# In this code, we've added routes to book tickets for movies and events. We've also implemented the corresponding functionality in the Booking model to save booking information to the database.
# You can book tickets for a movie by making a POST request to /bookings/movies/<movie_id> and book tickets for an event by making a POST request to /bookings/events/<event_id>.
